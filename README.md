# netbsd6
This is pkgsrc for the netbsd6 with all the corrections to make it happen

This is done because there are some OLD computers AKA compaq notebooks (P2) that simply refuses do DIE,
and does not work with anything more than NetBSD6.
The notebooks are being used in public schools to serve poor children that needs to study,
and break the poverty cicle of poverty, no education, so, poverty... 
The idea is to give them access to education using http://khanacademy.org
This pkgsrc version is a high modified pkgsrc-2017Q2 that builds tha mate desktop http://mate-desktop.org
and so offer a platform of study for less than US$10  (TEN DOLLARS)...


Enjoy
